## 🎯 **What to Say in Presentation**

### **About Adobe Integration:**

> "On the enterprise integration side, we've architected connections with several platforms. We have working integrations with NewRelic for APM and Dynatrace for observability - providing real-time monitoring data.
>
> We've also built the architecture for Adobe PDF Services for automated report generation - you can see that code in our repo. It's production-ready, currently in mock mode due to enterprise account restrictions.
>
> What we DID use Adobe for is creating this presentation - Adobe Express and Firefly generated these custom images you're seeing. It demonstrates our understanding of AI-powered tools in practice."

**This is honest, professional, and highlights what matters!**
